# Proposed Plan for Earnings Call Transcript Analysis
## 8-10 Jan: Initial Setup and Data Exploration

- Setup the Environment

Create a GitHub repository for team collaboration.
Set up Jupyter Notebooks and install required libraries (PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK, transformers, pandas, sklearn, etc.).
Data Loading and Preprocessing

- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Data Cleaning:
Clean text data (remove irrelevant characters, stop words, punctuation).
Handle missing values in the dataset.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for future model evaluations.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore key statistics (number of companies, frequency of earnings calls per quarter, etc.).
Visualize text data (word clouds, frequent terms) to get an overview of the content.

## 11-13 Jan: Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment Analysis

Apply VADER or TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
Track sentiment trends over time (e.g., by quarter or sector).
Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Use spaCy or pre-trained models (e.g., from Hugging Face) to extract entities like company names, financial terms, dates, etc.

## 11-14 Jan: Advanced Text Analysis and Deep Learning Integration
- Topic Modeling and Keyword Extraction

Use LDA or NMF for topic modeling on the transcripts.
Extract keywords using TF-IDF or other feature extraction techniques.
Deep Learning for Complex Reasoning (using PyTorch)

- Set up a PyTorch-based model for one of the following:

Question Answering (QA): Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT or RoBERTa model for answering domain-specific questions from earnings calls (e.g., "What was the revenue growth for the quarter?").

Text Classification: Classify earnings call sentiment or categorize them into different topics using a simple neural network or Transformer-based models.
Training:

Fine-tune pre-trained models or train custom models on labeled data (if available).
## 12-15 Jan: Knowledge Graph and Summarization
- Building a Knowledge Graph

Create a graph representing relationships between companies, financial terms, and events.
Use NetworkX or Neo4j for graph creation.
Visualize the graph to show key relationships.
- Text Summarization

Use BART or T5 models for summarizing earnings call transcripts into concise summaries or reports.

## 12-15 Jan: Model Evaluation and Reporting
- Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using standard metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall for text classification and NER).
Use AUC-ROC for sentiment analysis and classification tasks.
- Final Report and Visualization
Prepare a final report summarizing:

Key insights from sentiment analysis, NER, and topic modeling.
Visualizations (e.g., sentiment over time, word clouds, network graphs).
The performance of deep learning models.
Collaborative Documentation: Ensure the project is well-documented in the GitHub repository, including instructions on how to run the code and interpret results.
